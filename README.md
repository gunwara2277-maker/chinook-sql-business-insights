# Chinook SQL Business Insights

This project is a SQL-based business analysis using the **Chinook sample database**.  
The objective is to demonstrate practical SQL skills by answering real-world business questions related to sales, customers, and employees.

The project focuses on **data analysis and business insights**, rather than complex SQL syntax, making it suitable for roles such as Product Manager (Tech), Business Analyst.

- **Source:** SQLite official tutorial
- **Domain:** Digital music store sales
- **Main Tables Used:** `invoices`, `customers`, `employees`

The Chinook database is widely used for learning and demonstrating SQL analysis skills in a business context.

## Business Questions & SQL Analysis

All SQL queries are stored in the `queries/` folder.

### Query 1: Top Countries by Invoice Count
- Identify which countries generate the highest number of invoices.

**File:** `01_invoices_by_country.sql`

---

### Query 2: Revenue by Country
- Calculate total revenue generated by each country.
- Useful for understanding geographic revenue distribution.

**File:** `02_revenue_by_country.sql`

---

### Query 3: Purchase Frequency per Customer
- Analyze how many times each customer made a purchase.
- Helps identify repeat customers.

**File:** `03_purchase_frequency_by_customer.sql`

---

### Query 4: Top Customers by Revenue
- Identify the customers who generate the highest total revenue.
- Useful for customer value and retention analysis.

**File:** `04_top_customers_by_revenue.sql`

---

### Query 5: Invoice Value Segmentation
- Segment invoices into value tiers:
  - **A:** Low value
  - **AA:** Medium value
  - **AAA:** High value
- Analyze invoice distribution and revenue contribution by segment.

**File:** `05_invoice_value_segmentation.sql`

---

### Query 6: Customers per Employee
- Analyze how many customers each employee is responsible for.
- Useful for workload distribution and support analysis.

**File:** `06_customers_per_employee.sql`

## Key Business Insights

### 1) Top Countries by Invoice Count
- **USA** has the highest number of invoices, followed by **Canada** and **France**.
- This suggests sales volume is concentrated in a few core markets (North America + parts of Europe).

**Why it matters**
- Prioritize retention and always-on campaigns in the top market (USA).
- Consider localized promotions for secondary high-volume countries (e.g., Canada, France, Brazil).

---

### 2) Revenue by Country
- **USA** generates the highest total revenue, followed by **Canada** (consistent with invoice volume).
- Some countries may generate strong revenue despite fewer invoices, implying higher average order value.

**Why it matters**
- Evaluate **Average Revenue per Invoice** alongside volume to avoid “volume-only” decisions.
- Enable country-level strategies (pricing, bundles, regional promotions).

---

### 3) Purchase Frequency per Customer
- Many customers purchase multiple times (top customers show **~6–7 purchases**), indicating repeat behavior rather than one-time buying.

**Why it matters**
- Strong signal for loyalty/retention programs (e.g., rewards, personalized recommendations).
- Supports lifecycle marketing (repeat purchase nudges, reactivation campaigns).

---

### 4) Top Customers by Revenue
- Revenue is concentrated among a small group of high-value customers (Top 10 customers spend significantly above average).

**Why it matters**
- Protect and retain high-value customers (VIP care, proactive support).
- Losing a few top customers can materially impact total revenue (Pareto-like pattern).

---

### 5) Invoice Value Segmentation (A / AA / AAA)
- **AAA (high-value invoices)** are fewer in count but contribute the most revenue.
- **A (low-value invoices)** are the most frequent but contribute lower revenue per invoice.

**Why it matters**
- Revenue growth is driven by increasing invoice value (upsell/cross-sell), not just increasing volume.
- Use segmentation to design pricing and promotion tactics to move customers **A → AA → AAA**.

---

### 6) Customers per Employee
- Customer workload is not evenly distributed across employees (some employees handle many customers while others handle few/none).

**Why it matters**
- Highlights opportunities to rebalance assignment for operational efficiency.
- Useful for workload planning, performance tracking, and staffing decisions.

## Overall Value Delivered
This project demonstrates the ability to translate raw transactional data into actionable business insights across:
- **Market performance** (country-level volume & revenue)
- **Customer value** (repeat purchase behavior & top spenders)
- **Revenue mix** (invoice segmentation)
- **Operations** (support workload distribution)
